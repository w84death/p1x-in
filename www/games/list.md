Story

"We are the cab company for the rich business people. We transport them directly from their offices in the highest skyscrapers. Sometimes they want to move quickly form one floor to another. But most of the time they take a ride to another skyscraper at the exact floor. This saves they time and money. So travel time here is very important."

"Ofcourse you can never forget about the safety. There are lots of other flying cars out there. Also avoid any damage to the vehicle. And remember that cabs don't run on air so save fuel. Repair and refuel will be paid from your paycheck."
