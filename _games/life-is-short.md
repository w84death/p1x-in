Slavic Game Jam 2019 game about growing.

You are the young caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland. In the book Alice meets the Caterpillar, who teaches her to use pieces of mushroom to control her size. In the game you eat shrooms, grows, shrink and try to survive as long as you can scoring more points.

Idea notes:

- You are a little caterpillar
- You need to eat many shrooms to become bigger
- collect additional coins for points
- bugs will try to hit you that will make you smaller
- biggest enemy is a raven
    - ravens flies above, you only see a shadow
    - when the shadow is over you there is a chance that a raven will eat you
    - the bigger you are the bigger chance
    - try to hide and avoid ravens
