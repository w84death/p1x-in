This game was made mainly for me to learn assemlby language. It is completely written in ARM Assembly. To make it easy I created a simple text based adventure game concept.

You can only use few commands. Move thru rooms (caves in this case) and trigger diffrent scenarios. And die a lot.

Episode one is placed in the cave. Player needs to escape before torch burns out. On the way player must go to each room in ideal conbination to solve the whole puzzle. Sometimes waiting in one room for few turns is advised.
